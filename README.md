# On-Demand Delivery System 

On-Demand Delivery System (OODS) is an application that provides delivery services for daily necessities. This benefits local businesses that have suffered as a result of the popularity of online shopping. Furthermore, people nowadays do not have time to shop for daily necessities.

The user can place orders for products from these local shops through our mobile application. User can choose between home delivery and self-collection in the shop.Â 

The application is complete with product browsing, the ordering process, and the payment gateway (PayPal) to make a payment.
